# NLP-Group-7-Project


Numerous music streaming services have tackled the problem of classifying a songâ€™s
genre. This is largely due to the fact that labeling a song with multiple genres, or rather
features, allows a service to perform tasks like song recommendation, curated playlist
creation, and data analysis. However, many feel that genre classification is not as accurate
as it should be. Thus, we decide to investigate how from a linguistic perspective, we could
classify songs into distinct genres. Our results show that a vector representation using
TF-IDF can work, but can be improved upon utilizing other models such as Word2Vec.
Additionally, we see that with just using textual features, we have greater success labelling
a song in a binary fashion i.e rap or not. This repository contains the code and data for the various approaches of our song genre classifier.
